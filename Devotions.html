<h4><span style="color: red;"> Beautiful Life of Discipline</span></h4>
<p>Hey Friends, Opportunity should always meet preparation or preparedness. Even scriptures teaches that God will bless the labour of our hands not the laziness.</p>
<p>This shows that there is an abiding structure. While it is Good to Rest, let it not be because we're lazy. We can as well rest because we're tired, this is because we're engaged in something.</p>
<p>Have clear visions and directions of what you're doing or want to do, even the scriptures teaches that we write our visions, make it plain, that they that readeth should run well.</p>
Clarity will always save you. So, Excuses will make today easy but the future harder. Discipline is harder today but makes the future easier. <br>So, choose your hard.
<p>DISCIPLINE IS HARD, but the results are always beautiful. Discipline breeds consistency.</p> In every facet of life. Not just ministry. A disciplined man will make tangible progress.
<p>Discipline doesnâ€™t look at convenience. It teaches you to do the needful despite your convenience.</p>
<P>Subscribing to its tutelage helps one to make progress. E go con be like say you do jazz. Giving excuses breeds inconsistency and failure. I wonder how people have an excuse every time. I mean no one has it all figured out, we are all trying to figure it out. Subscribing to discipline helps us figure things out and then progress is made. The problem people have with not being consistent is tailored to the fact that they are indisciplined.</P>
<p>Once the discipline factor is imbibed, consistency becomes a default setting. Discipline is a culture that defines a stable life.
Once again, choose your hard.</p>

<h4><span style="color: red;">The Believer and Prayer.</span></h4>
<p>Something to learn here , you'll notice everything the will of God is mentioned, prayer or praying is in view</p>
Matthew 26:39 And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and PRAYED, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.
<p>Thus, we see in prayers or praying we're partnering with God's will for the earth.</p>
<p>Another example</p>
1 Timothy  2:4 Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.
<p>Notice God our savior will is that all men be saved? Yet in verse 1 of same chapter, prayer is in view </p>
1 Timothy  2:1 I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men;
<p>In verse 3 he said this is "Good" Kalos in the Greek, used for what is proper and fitting. Used in Mathew 3:10. This is proper, acceptable, in God's face, sight and presence.</p>
<p>Another case</p>
Matthew  6:9 After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.
<p>After this manner, look at verse 2</p>
Matthew  6:10 Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.
<p>They kingdom come, is God's will on earth and the manner is prayers.</p>
<p>Thus anytime we pray, God's will is done on the earth, God's kingdom reigns on the earth. So, prayer is the manner we partner.</p>
<p>Notice the opposite of this kingdom </p>
Luke  22:53  When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness
<p>Notice, stretching forth their hands against him is called "the power or kingdom" of darkness. In Acts we see something similar</p>
Acts  12:1 Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church.<br>
Acts  12:2 And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.
<p>He didn't stop there</p>
Acts  12:3 And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.)
<p>But we see that God's kingdom rule isn't automatic, thus prayers was made in the case of Peter</p>
Acts  12:5 Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him.
<P>So, you see it wasn't God's unique need or desire for James to die.</P>
